# Testing and its types

### What is testing?

Testing is the process which is used to find the bugs in a given application. Every object created either in the software field or in the real world needs to be ested before it is given to the end user, the main purpose being user satisfaction. If an object is not tested in the right way it leads to bugs which can even result in hazardous outcomes of the developed object. Even though all the appications developed are tested in a greated extent there will still be one or an other unidentified bug which will get discovered later somtimes even when the project is about to end. It is not that easy to develop and test an application which is cent percent defect free.

### Types of testing:

Testing is mainly performed in two ways, which are:

1.  Manual
2.  Automaton

### Manual Testing:

*   This is one of the old fashioned technique for testing an application which does not involve any tools but still highly used in many organizations
*   In this testig each and every module of the application is tested manually.
*   Different types of manual testing methods are:

1.  Unit Testing
2.  Accecptance Testing
3.  System Testing

### Automation Testing:

*   Different Tools are used in this process to test an application
*   This type of testing requires less man power as everything is automated and for future enhancements we only require few modifications to the existing script
